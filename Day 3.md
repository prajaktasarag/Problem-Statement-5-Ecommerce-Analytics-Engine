Scope Note: The original presentation continues after DOM with Event Handling, Callback, Promise, Async/Await, and Closures. Those topics are intentionally not included here.

1. Introduction to JavaScript
1.1 What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a programming language used to add behavior and interactivity to web applications.

According to the supplied presentation:

JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich.
It was initially created for adding simple interactivity in the Netscape browser.
It is an important core technology in web application development along with HTML and CSS.
1.2 Where Does JavaScript Run?
Environment	Role
Browser	Client-side scripting, interactivity, and DOM updates
Node.js	Server-side scripting, backend applications, and APIs
Cross-platform frameworks	Desktop, mobile, and IoT applications
1.3 HTML, CSS and JavaScript
Technology	Responsibility	Examples
HTML	Structure	Headings, paragraphs, buttons
CSS	Styling	Colors, layout, animations
JavaScript	Behavior	Click actions, form validation, dynamic content
Simple Analogy
Think of a webpage as a building:

HTML → Structure
CSS → Appearance
JavaScript → Behavior and interaction
2. Basics of JavaScript
2.1 Variables
Variables are named storage locations used to hold values.

The presentation introduces three variable keywords:

var
Used in older JavaScript code.
The presentation recommends using it mainly when old-browser support is required.
let
Introduced in 2015.
Cannot be redeclared in the same scope.
const
Introduced in 2015.
Cannot be redeclared.
Cannot be reassigned.
Has block scope.
2.2 When to Use var, let, or const
The supplied presentation recommends:

Always declare variables.
Use const if the value should not be changed.
Use const if the type/reference should not be changed, including arrays and objects.
Use let only when const cannot be used.
Use var only when you must support old browsers.
Example
const college = "SSGMCE";
let count = 25;

count = count + 1;

// Reassignment of a const variable is not allowed:
// college = "ABC";
2.3 Data Types
The presentation covers the following data types:

Data Type	Meaning	Example
String	Text	"Apexaiq"
Number	Numeric value	25, 3.14
Boolean	Logical value	true, false
Null	Intentional empty value	null
Undefined	Declared but not assigned	undefined
Object	Collection of key-value pairs	{ name: "A" }
Array	Ordered collection of values	[10, "JS", true]
2.4 Operators
Arithmetic Operators
+   -   *   /   %
Used for calculations.

Comparison Operators
==   ===   !=   <   >
Used to compare values.

Logical Operators
&&   ||   !
&& → AND
|| → OR
! → NOT
Assignment Operators
=   +=   -=   *=   /=
Used to assign or update values.

3. Control Flow
Control flow determines which statements execute and how many times they execute.

The presentation covers:

Conditional Statements
Loops
3.1 Conditional Statements
if
Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.

else
Executes a block if the condition is false.

else if
Tests another condition when the previous condition is false.

switch
Used to specify many alternative blocks of code.

Example: if / else if / else
const marks = 78;

if (marks >= 90) {
    console.log("Excellent");
} else if (marks >= 60) {
    console.log("Good");
} else {
    console.log("Needs improvement");
}
Example: switch
const day = 2;

switch (day) {
    case 1:
        console.log("Monday");
        break;

    case 2:
        console.log("Tuesday");
        break;

    default:
        console.log("Invalid day");
}
3.2 Loops
The presentation covers five types:

Loop	Use
for	Loops through a block of code a specified number of times
for/in	Loops through the properties of an object
for/of	Loops through the values of an iterable
while	Loops while a specified condition is true
do/while	Executes the block and continues while the condition is true
Example: for
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
Example: for...of
const fruits = ["Apple", "Mango", "Banana"];

for (const fruit of fruits) {
    console.log(fruit);
}
4. Functions
4.1 What is a Function?
A function is a block of code designed to perform a task.

According to the presentation:

A function runs when it is called/invoked.
Functions help in reusing code.
4.2 Key Concepts
Concept	Meaning
Parameters	Input values
Return	Output value
Global Scope	Accessible from broader/global code
Local Scope	Available inside a function
Block Scope	Available inside { } when using let/const
4.3 Types of Functions
1. Function Declaration
Defined using the function keyword.
Hoisted.
Can be called before its declaration.
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

console.log(add(10, 20));
2. Function Expression
A function stored in a variable.
Used after its definition.
const greet = function(name) {
    return "Hello " + name;
};
3. Arrow Function
Introduced with ES6.
Uses the => syntax.
Does not have its own this.
const square = (n) => n * n;
4. Anonymous Function
A function without a name.

It is often used as a callback.

5. Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)
A function that runs automatically after being defined.

6. Higher-Order Function
A function that:

Takes another function as an argument, or
Returns another function.
7. Recursive Function
A function that calls itself.

function countdown(n) {
    if (n === 0) return;

    console.log(n);
    countdown(n - 1);
}
5. Arrays
5.1 What is an Array?
An array is an ordered list of values.

The presentation notes that arrays can store:

Numbers
Strings
Objects
Functions
Example
const fruits = ["Apple", "Mango", "Banana"];

console.log(fruits[0]); // Apple
console.log(fruits[2]); // Banana
5.2 Array Properties and Methods
Property / Method	Purpose
.length	Returns the total number of items
.push()	Adds an item at the end
.pop()	Removes an item from the end
.shift()	Removes the first item
.unshift()	Adds an item at the start
.map()	Processes array items and creates a new array
.filter()	Creates a new array containing matching items
.reduce()	Combines values into an accumulated result
Example
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

numbers.push(4);
numbers.pop();

numbers.unshift(0);
numbers.shift();

const doubled = numbers.map(n => n * 2);

const even = numbers.filter(n => n % 2 === 0);

const total = numbers.reduce((sum, n) => sum + n, 0);
5.3 Why Arrays Are Useful
Store multiple related values in one variable.
Access values using their position/index.
Process collections efficiently using methods such as map(), filter(), and reduce().
6. Objects
6.1 What is an Object?
An object is a collection of key-value pairs.

According to the presentation:

Keys are properties.
Keys are always strings or symbols.
Values can be anything: strings, numbers, arrays, functions, or other objects.
Example
const student = {
    name: "Aarav",
    age: 20,
    skills: ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript"]
};
6.2 Features of Objects
The supplied presentation identifies these features:

Accessing Properties
Adding Properties
Updating Properties
Deleting Properties
Methods
Built-in Object Methods
Accessing Properties
console.log(student.name);

console.log(student["age"]);
Adding a Property
student.city = "Shegaon";
Updating a Property
student.age = 21;
Deleting a Property
delete student.city;
Object with a Method
const user = {
    name: "Aarav",

    greet: function() {
        return "Hello " + this.name;
    }
};

console.log(user.greet());
6.3 Arrays vs Objects
Array	Object
Ordered collection of values	Collection of key-value pairs
Usually accessed using an index	Usually accessed using a property/key
Useful for lists and collections	Useful for describing entities and their properties
7. DOM — Document Object Model
7.1 What is the DOM?
DOM stands for Document Object Model.

According to the supplied presentation:

The DOM is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents.
It represents the page structure as a tree of nodes.
Nodes can include elements, attributes, text, etc.
JavaScript can manipulate the DOM to change page content, style, or structure dynamically.
7.2 DOM Tree
The original presentation contains a DOM tree diagram.

The diagram represents the structure approximately as:

Document
   |
   └── <html>
       |
       ├── <head>
       │    |
       │    └── <title>
       │          |
       │          └── Text: "My title"
       |
       └── <body>
            |
            ├── <a>
            │    ├── Attribute: href
            │    └── Text: "My link"
            |
            └── <h1>
                 |
                 └── Text: "My header"
This demonstrates how a webpage can be represented as a hierarchy/tree.

7.3 Important DOM Nodes
Node / Part	Example
Document	The overall document
Element	<html>, <head>, <body>, <h1>, <a>
Attribute	href on an <a> element
Text	Text contained inside an element
7.4 Why is the DOM Important?
The presentation gives three major reasons:

1. Dynamic Content
The DOM lets JavaScript change content dynamically, such as:

Text
Images
2. User Interaction
The DOM enables interaction with users, such as:

Clicking buttons
Filling forms
3. Dynamic Websites
DOM manipulation helps create dynamic websites instead of static pages.

7.5 DOM Manipulation
The supplied presentation identifies four main DOM manipulation activities:

Selecting elements
Changing content
Changing style
Creating new elements
7.6 Selecting Elements
JavaScript can select HTML elements from the document.

getElementById()
const title = document.getElementById("title");
querySelector()
const heading = document.querySelector("h1");
querySelectorAll()
const buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button");
7.7 Changing Content
One way to change the text of an element is textContent.

const message = document.getElementById("message");

message.textContent = "Welcome to JavaScript!";
7.8 Changing Style
The style property can be used to modify inline styles.

const box = document.querySelector(".box");

box.style.fontSize = "24px";

box.style.padding = "20px";
7.9 Creating New Elements
JavaScript can create a new HTML element using document.createElement().

const paragraph = document.createElement("p");

paragraph.textContent =
    "This paragraph was created using JavaScript.";

document.body.appendChild(paragraph);
7.10 Mini DOM Example
This example combines:

DOM element selection
Content modification
Style modification
Creating a new element
HTML
<h1 id="title">Original Title</h1>

<button id="changeBtn">Change</button>

<div id="container"></div>
JavaScript
const title = document.getElementById("title");

const button = document.getElementById("changeBtn");

const container = document.getElementById("container");

button.addEventListener("click", () => {

    title.textContent = "Title Changed!";

    title.style.fontSize = "32px";

    const p = document.createElement("p");

    p.textContent = "New content added to the DOM.";

    container.appendChild(p);
});
Scope Note: The addEventListener() line is shown only to demonstrate how DOM manipulation can be triggered. Event Handling itself is the next topic in the original presentation and is outside this documentation scope.

7.11 DOM Learning Checklist
Before moving beyond DOM, you should be able to:

Explain what the DOM is.
Understand the DOM as a tree representation of a webpage.
Identify elements, attributes, and text nodes.
Select HTML elements using JavaScript.
Change an element's content.
Change an element's style.
Create new HTML elements.
Insert newly created elements into the document.

Callback
Promise
Async and Await
Closures
Those later sections are not covered because the requested scope ends at DOM.
